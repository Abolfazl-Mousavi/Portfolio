              When you've made the long journey through the dark up to the
              water's surface, opened your eyes and had them filled with the
              glimmering light of a billion stars as the eternal undulation of
              the ocean waves caress your cheek, lapped the salty taste of your
              tears that remind you of your salty home, can you imagine what
              that tiny bathtub here at Rhodes Island might be like for me...?
              I'll have to show you my home someday.
